## Introduction

The OSDU R2 Prototype Workflow service starts any business process in the system, such as ingestion
of OSDU data. The Workflow service provides a wrapper functionality around the Apache Airflow
functions and is designed to carry out a preliminary work with files before running the Airflow
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

Depending on the types of data, workflow, and user, the Workflow service starts a necessary workflow
such as well log LAS files ingestion or opaque ingestion.

## System interactions

The Workflow service in the OSDU R2 Prototype defines two workflows:

* Ingestion
* Delivering the current status of an ingestion job

### Ingestion

The ingestion workflow is defined for the `/startWorkflow` API. The following diagram shows the
workflow.

Upon the startWorkflow request:

1. Validate the incoming request.
    * Check that the workflow type corresponds to the allowed values &mdash; "ingest" or "osdu".
    * Check that the data type corresponds to the allowed values &mdash; "well_log" or "opaque".
2. Query the database to obtain a DAG suitable for the current request. The Workflow service
decides which DAG to run by the following three parameters:
    * WorkflowType
    * DataType
    * UserType
3. Submit a new ingestion job to the Workflow Engine (Apache Airflow).
4. Store the workflow data in the database with the SUBMITTED workflow status.
5. Respond with the workflow ID to the Ingestion service.

### Get workflow status

1. Query the database with the workflow ID to obtain the workflow job status.
    * Respond with the 404 Not Found error if the requested workflow ID isn't found.
2. Return the workflow job status to the user or application.

## Database interactions

Upon an ingestion request, the Workflow service needs to determine which DAG to run. To do that, the
service queries the database with the workflow type and data type.

The database stores the following information to help determine a DAG.

| Property     | Type     | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WorkflowType | `String` | One of two supported workflow types &mdash; "osdu" or "ingest" |
| DataType     | `String` | One of two supported data types &mdash; "well_log" or "opaque" |
| UserID       | `String` | A unique identifier of the user group or role                  |
| DAGName      | `String` | The name of the DAG                                            |

> **Note**: The OSDU R2 Prototype doesn't support the UserID property. When the security system is
> fully defined for OSDU R2, the UserID field will store the ID of the user group or role.

After a workflow starts, the Workflow service stores the following information about the workflow in
the database.

| Property     | Type     | Description                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WorkflowID   | `String` | Unique workflow ID                                                              |
| AirflowRunID | `String` | Unique Airflow process ID generated by the Workflow service                     |
| Status       | `String` | Current status of the workflow job &mdash; SUBMITTED, RUNNING, FINISHED, FAILED |
| SubmittedAt  | `String` | Timestamp when the workflow job was submitted to Workflow Engine                |
| SubmittedBy  | `String` | ID of the user role or group. Not supported in the OSDU R2 Prototype            |

## API

### POST /startWorkflow

Starts a new workflow. This API isn't available for third-party applications.

The `startWorkflow` API is a wrapper around the Airflow invocation, and it can reconfigure the
default workflows. For each combination of user, data, and workflow types, the API identifies a
suitable DAG and then calls Airflow.

For the OSDU R2 Prototype, the API doesn't reconfigure the workflows and only queries the database
to determine which DAG to run.

#### Request

The incoming request must contain the properties in the table below. All the given properties are
provided in the request body.

| Property     | Type     | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WorkflowType | `String` | Type of workflow job to run &mdash; "osdu" or "ingest"                     |
| DataType     | `String` | Type of data to be ingested &mdash; "well_log" or "opaque"                 |
| Context      | `List`   | Data required to run a particular DAG, provided as list of key-value pairs |

> The Context may include a file location, ACL and legal tags, and the Airflow run ID. The
> startWorkflow API passes the Context to Airflow without modifying it.

#### Response

| Property   | Type     | Description                   |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| WorkflowID | `String` | Unique ID of the workflow job |

### POST /getStatus

Returns the current status of a workflow job.

#### Request

The incoming request must contain the properties in the table below. All the given properties are
provided in the request body.

| Property   | Type     | Description                   |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| WorkflowID | `String` | Unique ID of the workflow job |

#### Response

If the workflow ID is found in the database, the following response is returned to the user.

| Property | Type     | Description                                                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status   | `String` | Current status of the workflow job &mdash; SUBMITTED, RUNNING, FINISHED, FAILED |

If the workflow ID isn't found in the database, the 404 Not found response is returned to the user.
